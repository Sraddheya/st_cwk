I removed tests that tested invalid values and did not affect the branch coverage. These were mainly tests from part 1 as they tested for a lot of bugs which were not thrown in the source and therefore did not affect the branch coverage. For example, testNullShortcut is a bug specifically used to try stop null shortcuts by using the function shortcutExists. However, this is not a specific branch in the source code, therefore any time shortcutExists is called, this branch is already covered. Though it is good to keep these types of tests as they catch bugs, the aim of this task was to minimise test suites because of lack of resources, and so finding bugs is not the criteria and so I deemed these types of tests to be redundant.

I removed any tests which overlapped with other tests because they included the same/overlapping functions. For example, the only thing the toString function in parser does is call the toString function in OptionMap. Therefore, by calling parser.toString, I covered both the toString functions in the Parser class and OptionMap class and could remove testToStringOptionMap.

I managed to remove some tests by combining several tests that looked at different branches of the same function. I made sure to only do this where the combined test did not use much more resources than any of the separte tests it replaced otherwise this would be useless.For example, before I separetly tested the replace function where there are 2 dashes "--", 1 dash "-" and no dashes for an option name and no dashes for a shortcut name. I kept these all separate before because it is better pratice to separate tests into smaller ones to more easily spot the specific error, but as the criteria was to save resources, I decided to combine them here into one test called testReplaceCombined.

Overall I managed to descrease the test suite from 70 tests with a coverage of 99.7% to 29 tests with a coverage of 99.6%. As I managed to reduce the number of tests by over half and only lose 0.1% of coverage, I believe my chosen test suite has fulfilled the goal of the task.
