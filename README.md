# Software Testing Cwk1

This course me provided with a broad overview of software testing techniques proven valuable across application domains. The goal of the course was to provide students with the skill to select and apply testing strategies and testing techniques that are appropriate to a particular software system or component. In addition I learnt how to use different test tools; assess the effectiveness of their testing activity; and provided evidence to justify their evaluation. 

Learning Outcomes
1. Analyze requirements to determine appropriate testing strategies
2. Design and implement comprehensive test plans with instrumented code
3. Apply a wide variety of testing techniques and compute test coverage and yield according to a variety of criteria
4. Evaluate the limitations of a given testing process, using statistical methods where appropriate, and summarise outcomes
5. Conduct reviews and inspections
